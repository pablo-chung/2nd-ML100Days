    "### Semantic Subject Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic subject indexing is the process of annotating documents with terms that describe what the document is about. This is often used in digital libraries to increase the findability of the documents. Annotations are usually created by human experts from the domain, who select appropriate terms from a pre-specified set of available labels. In order to keep up with the vast amount of new publications, (semi-)automatic tools are developed that assist the experts by suggesting them terms for annotation. Unfortunately, due to legal restrictions these tools often cannot use the full-text nor the abstract of the publication. Therefore, it is desirable to explore techniques that work with the publications' metadata only. To some extent, it is already possible to achieve competitive performance to the full-text by merely using titles. Yet, the performance of automatic subject indexing methods is still far from the level of human annotators. Semantic subject indexing can be framed as a multi-label classification problem, where the entry (i,j) of an indicator matrix is set to one if the label has been assigned to a document, or it is set to zero otherwise. A major challenge is that the label space is usually very large (up to almost 30,000), that the labels follow a power-law, and are subject to concept drift(cmp. Toepfer and Seifert)."
